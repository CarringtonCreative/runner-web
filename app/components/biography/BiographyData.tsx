    "Hi there! I'm a business analyst with over five years of experience working with top tech companies. Currently, I'm excited to be working temporarily at a big tech company, where I'm able to utilize my skills and expertise to help drive business growth and success. In my free time, I love to rock climb and hike in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. I'm also an avid reader, and you can usually find me with my nose buried in a good book. I'm excited to be working with such a talented team and can't wait to see what the future holds!",
